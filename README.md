## 🧠 Philosophy

**Fuck Linux** exists for those tired of bloat, hand-holding, and “Linux as a hobby project.” This distro is about **efficiency, sanity, and control.**

**Our principles:**

- ⚡ **Performance first** — minimal bloat, maximum speed  
- 🧰 **Sane defaults** — everything just works  
- 🔒 **User control** — you decide what runs, when it runs  
- 🐧 **Pure Linux, unfiltered** — no corporate compromises

## 🤘 Why Fuck Linux?

Because the Linux ecosystem has forgotten some basic rules:

- **Stop wasting time on tweaks.** Most distros expect you to be a full-time sysadmin just to install a web browser. Not here.  
- **Stop compromising for popularity.** “Works everywhere” is code for “slow, bloated, mediocre.” Fuck Linux works where it counts.  
- **Stop letting defaults control you.** Your system should obey you, not the distro maintainers.  

**Fuck Linux isn’t for everyone.** It’s for people who want a system that gets out of their way while still giving full control.

Fuck Linux is **opinionated**. If you’re into hand-holding, corporate defaults, or endless “just install this dependency” tutorials, this distro will probably frustrate you.
